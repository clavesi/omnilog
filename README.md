# Omnilog

Omnilog is a cataloging service, similar to Letterboxd or Goodreads. It's intended to be a amalgam of the best features of the various cataloging services with a catalog of all types of media, not just movies or books.

The planned catalog consists of

- Movies
- Shows
- Anime
- Manga
- Books
- Songs
- Video Games
